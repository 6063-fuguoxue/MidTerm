# Midterm Notes
## Milestone 1: Project Proposal
### Magazine: The Secret Life of Cats by National Geographic
I recently bought a magazine named "The Secret Life of Cats". It is a reissue of a national geographic favorite, which contains many beautiful photos of cats and stories about the human-cat bond. The "cats" in this magazine refer not only to commonly seen domestic cats, but to the whole Felidae family including tigers, panthers, and so on. Since I love cats, and there are many classic and understandable symbolic languages in human culture that refer to felines, I decided to design a cover for this magazine. 

<img src="./original-cover.jpg" alt="Original Magazine Cover" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;">

### Planning
The cover will include the biological characteristics of the cats, such as their eyes, the patterns of their furs, their paws, their tails, and so on. It can also include things related to cats like catnip and fish. If appropriate, I will also include some human elements to showcase the human-cat bond. 

I designed the cover to be both interactive and time-based. Some ideas I want to experiment with are listed below: 
<ol>
  <li>The background color can change according to the current time of the day. </li>
  <li>When clicking on the digital magazine cover, a paw appears at the clicking position as if a cat responds to the click. </li>
  <li>The shape of cats' pupils can change according to the current time of the day. </li>
  <li>A cat's eyes can follow the mouse's movement (this happens to be a witty metaphor). </li>
  <li>The background can be filled with different patterns of different cat furs. It changes after every click on the background. </li>
</ol>

### Sketches
Below are some sketches of the cover:
